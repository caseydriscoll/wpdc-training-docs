This is a packet and repository of training worksheets and helper documents.

The purpose of this packet is to create an *analog* structure and flow to the evening. Students may be completely new and have a wide variety of skills, knowledge and starting points. This packet helps intercept *everyone* and gives them a common starting ground.

The packet is written in HTML, with styles optimized for printing, so that others may easily fork and change.

PDFs are saved as a snapshot and added to repo for even easier print and sharing access.
